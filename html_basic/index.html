    <h1>Nangami portfolio</h1>
    <p>Hello and thank you for visiting my portfolio! This website showcases my journey as a learner and aspiring developer.
        I'm excited to share some of the projects i've worked on, the skills I've acquired, and the goals I'm working towards in the world of technology.
    </p>

    <h2>First project</h2>

    <p>
         This is my first portfolio project, built using basic HTML as part of my web development learning path. It serves as the foundation upon which I’ll continue building more complex and
          interactive web pages as I progress through my studies.
    </p>

    <h3> Links </h3>

    <p>
        within this portfolio, you'll find links to various projects, brief descriptions of what they do, and what i learned from each experience.
         As I improve my coding and design skills, I'll keep updating this page to reflect my growth and achievements.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’m passionate about learning new technologies and solving real-world problems
         through programming. Whether you’re here to see my work or just stopping by, I hope you find something that inspires you. Stay tuned for more updates!
    </p>
